      <p>Masashi Murakami is the co-founder of the Tokyo-based graphic design studio emuni. His studio  works with poster design, branding, packaging, signage and editorial, crafting a broad range of materials for the commercial sphere

      <p>Yet, Murakami also uses his practice to ask questions of language, materiality, and data across digital and print matter. These questions manifest in his latest solo exhibition with Japanese paper company Takeo: a company that asks graphic designers to experiment and play with their paper and printing technologies  in a semi-annual “Aoyama Creators Stock” exhibition.

      <p>Masashi’s 2019 solo exhibition pushes us beyond our assumptions of the limitations embedded in print work. His pieces appear, from afar, to be digital images: manifestations of digital manipulation and editing techniques. Yet, each distortion indicates analogue working methods that incite physical change on the form of the paper and the materials Masashi chose. One poster literally drips over and down the edges of a rectangular block. Another appears to have been erased by a digital brush made physical, fragments of its composition suspended in space. 
      </p>

      <p>In an interview with It’s Nice That, Murakami “I produced these pieces based on my belief that commonly seen digital expressions can have a completely new expression…it can tug at people’s heartstrings if I take the opposite approach of using analogue methods to give digital themes physical properties, rather than using digital methods to create analogue expressions, which is commonly seen today.”
      </p>

    <div class="wrapper">

      <p>Not only does Murakami see these pieces as a reversal of our typical understanding of the relationship between digital and analogue spaces, but he understands this work as pushing the boundaries inherent to language:  boundaries that determine how we engage with one another and limit who has access to particular spaces, knowledge, and cultural production.  
      </p>

      <p>He describes “I wanted to create pieces that can go beyond the walls of graphic design, under the hypothesis that it would be possible to transcend language by freeing characters from their meaning and reinterpreting them as shapes.”
      </p>

      <p>There also lies in this hypothesis about language, a potential to think critically about Murakami’s use of English in these posters:

      <h3>How can this impulse to “transcend language” and free these signs of their <i>meaning</i> be rectified with the use of English: a hegemonic tool of neocolonial and imperial domination?</h3>

      <p>As Yan Guo and Gulbahar H. Beckett discuss in their essay “The Hegemony of English as a Global Language: Reclaiming Local Knowledge and Culture in China,” “the hegemony of English as a global language is evidently a paradigm serving Western capitalism and neocolonialism, which creates a misconception that English is the superior language and that English is better taught by native speakers of English.”</p>

      <p>While, Murakami’s posters do not contend with language as a hegemonic form, they present an avenue to think about how language reads when partially deconstructed. The Latin characters of Murakami’s posters are not distorted so much as to prevent the viewer from understanding their meaning. In fact, it is our ability to read fragments of each affect that allows us to understand the transformation applied in each context. What does this process of reading do for the viewer? How is their experience conditioned by the meaning and constructed dominance embedded in the English language?
      </p>

      <p>English has been constructed as socially important, but its pedagogy also has significant material consequences. As the language of the United States and other high capitalist superpowers, English serves as a tool of imperial power and leverages social and economic capital in global markets. How then, in considering the material and symbolic power of linguistic forms, might we read Murakami’s exploration of transcending boundaries of language?
